'''All the messages sent by the bot are here. It follows the pattern:

       "message_code":
       """message to be sent and {placeholder}"""

   {placeholders} are dynamically replaced by something else before being sent.
   
   It's ok to remove a placeholder completely.
   
   Adding a new placeholder, changing a placeholder's code, or changing the
   message_code WILL BREAK the message and the bot won't be able to send it.
   
   The only HTML tags supported are <b>, <i>, <code> and <a href="...">. Any
   other tag, as well as nesting and unclosed tags are not supported and WILL
   BREAK the message. If you want to send "<" or ">" use "&lt;" and "&gt;" instead.
